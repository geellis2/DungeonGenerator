This program is meant to supplement the creativity of a dungeon master.

essentially it will build a group of encounters that are what should be expected at a given level. However, it will not build complicated backstories or explain the reasoning behind each encounter. generally it would be best for the dungeon master to create their own dungeons with topical enemies, but this program is for those times when it just isn't possible.

to use:
run make, then type ./DG "beastiary filename" "APL"
where "beastiary filename" should be beastiary.txt or another file following the same format as beastiary.txt
and "APL" is the average party level, which can e found in the pathfinder srd at http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/

features that should be added:
this program will generate a dungeon filled with semi-related monsters, but it hasn't been made meticulous enough to generate dungeons that actually make sense. 
It would be nice to add a large number of Boss npcs that are essentially just well built characters at any given level.
make the information presented more as a story rather than a list of bad guys.
better description and generation of traps.
allow user to specify whether they want traps.

Code needs to be commented better, and should be seperated into different files, rather than just thrown into one called beastiary.cpp
not sure about asking user for beastiary file, but not poisons file.


currently this program uses a list of monsters from http://d20pfsrd.com
